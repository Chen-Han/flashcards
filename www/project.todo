Local storage still not working, can someone look into it??
Also would be nice to have a menu.html with a list that dislays all data.(categories)

ISSUES:
empty category is literally a card, -> fix: display some texts under the card
swipe down to clear card not really needed when opening up the app the second time.

fix local storage
fix empty category problem


FURTHER FEATURE:
Firebase syncing
local to Firebase merging
image support
HTML card rendering
